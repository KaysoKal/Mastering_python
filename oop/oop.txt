Python OOP concepts, including classes, objects, and real-world examples

Classes
    classes are blueprint for developing objects to avoid repetitions and increase scalability

    syntax:
    class name:
        def __init__(self, other arugments you want to add) # init creates the object for a class and intialize the attrubites 
        # self is a varabile that allows you to add attributres to the object being created
            # self could be a speific superhero or a dog or a car etc. Also other methods have access to self to referred to the specifc object.
        # example self.car = car which is assign to that specific object

Methods:
    Are functions define in a class
  instances Methods:
    ex: def __init__(self, other arugments you want to add):
    in pyhton the init is the constructor which is to create or initalzize the object
    they are called in the main using dot notation
 
  Class Methods:
    ex: is def class_method(cls): # use cls to access class attributes
    or can use @classmethod then def class_method(cls) just more easier to read
    and access by using dot notation in side of class or main

  staticMethods:
  Static methods belong to the class, not the instance.
  They donâ€™t use self or cls
  They are like utility functions that are logically related to the class.

Attribute:
  instance Attribute:
    variables assocates with the object
    ex: # example self.car = car which is assign to that specific object

    accessing attrubites out side of the class use dot notation
    ex: print(ironman.power) 
    and modify value through the same way you access it just set it equal.
  
  Classes attributes:
    are shared across instances. You can call them by classname.classattribute 


Object:
    we created the object by calling the class and passing the right arugments 
    ex: ironman = superhero("ironman, "repluse cannon", 6, 8) # health is 6 and power level is 8 and class name is superhero



Encapulation:
    Is hiding the interal details of how something works and only showing what is need
    By default all attributes or methods are public default

    protected attributes can not be access outside the class, only inside the class or subclass and it denoted with a single underscore
        ex: self._name

    to access a protected attrubites access the pubic methods
    to access a protected method use the public Method


    Private not accessable outside the class or the child class
    denoted as double underscores
    you can access it inside a class but it best to make a public method to access the private attribute or private method
        which getter and setters comein in handy, setter method is updating value for the private attributes
        Getter is to saftely read a value from a private attributes

    Ways to use getter and setter 
        @property: 
        #KEEP IN MIND property is treates like an attribute not a function so when calling it->
        its obj.attribute not obj.attribute()
        Lets you define a method that can be accessed like an attribute (without parentheses).
        Provides a cleaner, more Pythonic and efficient way to control access to private variables compared to traditional getter and setter method
       


Inheritance 
  is a subclass of a class
    -  inherits properties and methods from a parent class
    - useful for situation for is-a reltionship(like a animal(superclass) and the different types of animals(subclass)) and reuse code

  overide a method:
    - create a subclass, call the main and then make the same method to overide it 
    - Super().method calls a method from parent class, used inside a subclass
