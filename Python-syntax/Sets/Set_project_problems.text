1. Beginner Level: Create a Set and Add/Remove Elements
Problem:
Write a program to:

Create a set of numbers from 1 to 10.
Add the number 11 to the set.
Remove the number 5 from the set.
Print the final set.
Goal:
Understand how to create sets, add elements using add(), and remove elements using remove() or discard().


Problem: Remove Duplicates from a List
Difficulty: Easy

Description: Write a Python function that accepts a list of integers as input and returns a set 
that contains only the unique elements of the list.


2. Intermediate Level: Filter Elements in a Set
Problem:
Write a function that:

Takes a set of integers.
Filters out all the even numbers.
Returns a new set containing only the odd numbers.
Hint:

Use the filter() function or a set comprehension to filter elements based on conditions (in this case, odd numbers).
Goal:

Learn how to filter elements from a set using built-in functions like filter() or using set comprehensions.
3. Advanced Level: Perform Set Operations and Combine Results
Problem:
You are given two sets:

Set A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Set B: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Write a program that:

Creates both sets.
Finds the union of both sets.
Finds the intersection of both sets.
Finds the difference between Set A and Set B.
Finds the symmetric difference between Set A and Set B.
Returns all the results as individual sets.
Goal:

Understand how to perform set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference using methods like .union(), .intersection(), .difference(), and .symmetric_difference(), as well as the corresponding operators (|, &, -, ^).
Summary of Operations:
Add Elements: add()
Remove Elements: remove(), discard()
Filter Elements: filter() or set comprehensions
Set Operations: .union(), .intersection(), .difference(), .symmetric_difference()
