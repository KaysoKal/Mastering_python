Easy: Basic Dictionary Operations
Create a dictionary that stores three favorite foods and their prices.
Retrieve the price of one specific food item from the dictionary.
Add a new item to the dictionary with a price.
Update the price of an existing item in the dictionary.
Remove an item from the dictionary.



Medium: Dictionary Iteration & Manipulation
Print all keys and values in the dictionary in a formatted way.
Check if a specific item exists in the dictionary before accessing it.
Increase all prices by 10% and update the dictionary.
Count how many items in the dictionary have a price greater than $5.
Merge two dictionaries containing food items and their prices.


Intermediate Level: Filter and Modify a List of Dictionaries
Problem:
You are given a list of dictionaries representing students' information, where each dictionary contains the following keys:

"name" (string)
"age" (integer)
"score" (integer)
Write a function to filter out students who are younger than 18 and have a score below 50, and return the names of the remaining students as a list.

You need to use filter(), map(), and lambda functions to solve this.



Hard: Nested Dictionaries & Complex Operations
Create a nested dictionary where each item has a price and a stock quantity.
inventory = {
    "apple": {"price": 1.20, "stock": 10},
    "milk": {"price": 3.00, "stock": 5},
}
Find the total cost if you were to buy one of each item in the dictionary.
Sort the dictionary by price in ascending order and print the results.
Convert the dictionary to a list of tuples (item, price) and sort by price.
Remove all items from the dictionary that have a price below $2
