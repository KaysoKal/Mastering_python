Rule-of-Thumb Guide for Solving Coding Problems

1. Understand the problem fully
   - Read carefully and identify input/output.
   - Clarify constraints and edge cases.
   - Example: empty inputs, very large inputs, duplicates, etc.

2. Break the problem into steps
   - Don’t try to solve everything at once.
   - Write down subtasks or smaller functions.
   - Example: “Traverse the list → Compare values → Merge nodes”.

3. Choose the right data structure
   - Picking the right structure simplifies the solution:
     - Linked list → for dynamic insertion/deletion
     - Array → for random access
     - Hash map → for fast lookups
     - Stack/queue → for LIFO/FIFO logic

4. Use pointers/indices smartly
   - For arrays: use indices (i, j).
   - For linked lists: use temp pointers (current, prev, next).
   - Keep the original reference to avoid losing data.

5. Handle edge cases first
   - Check for empty inputs, single-element inputs, and max/min values.
   - Example in linked lists: if not head: return None.

6. Think iteratively and incrementally
   - Use l




# Python Coding Patterns Cheat Sheet (Comprehensive)

This guide shows **major data structures**, **key patterns**, and examples to learn for Python coding problems.

## 1️⃣ Arrays

**Key Patterns:**
- Two Pointers → Move pointers from both ends or in the same direction  
  *Example:* Two Sum (sorted), Container With Most Water, Move Zeroes
- Sliding Window → Maintain a window of elements  
  *Example:* Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Maximum Sum Subarray
- Prefix Sum / Cumulative Sum → Precompute sums  
  *Example:* Subarray Sum Equals K
- Hash Map / Frequency Counting → Count occurrences  
  *Example:* Two Sum (unsorted), Majority Element
- Sorting + Two Pointers → Sort first, then two pointers  
  *Example:* 3Sum, Merge Intervals

## 2️⃣ Strings

**Key Patterns:**
- Sliding Window → Longest/shortest substring problems  
- Two Pointers → Reverse strings, check palindromes  
- Frequency Counting / Hash Map → Track duplicates or anagrams  
- Stack / Greedy → Remove duplicates, evaluate expressions

---

## 3️⃣ Linked Lists

**Key Patterns:**
- Slow & Fast Pointers → Detect cycles, find middle node  
- Merge / Split Lists → Merge sorted lists, reorder nodes  
- Dummy Node → Simplify head/tail manipulations  
- Reverse / Reorder → Reverse sublist, reverse entire list

---

## 4️⃣ Stacks

**Key Patterns:**
- Balanced Parentheses / Matching → Use stack to match elements  
- Monotonic Stack → Track next greater/smaller elements  
- Backtracking / Undo Operations → Store previous states  
- DFS using Stack → Simulate recursion iteratively

---

## 5️⃣ Queues

**Key Patterns:**
- BFS → Level-order traversal, shortest paths  
- Sliding Window / Fixed-size Queue → Maintain elements in a window  
- Monotonic Queue → Track min/max efficiently  
- Simulation / FIFO operations → Circular Queue, Recent Counter

---

## 6️⃣ Heaps / Priority Queues

**Key Patterns:**
- Min-Heap / Max-Heap → Get smallest/largest efficiently  
- Kth Largest / Smallest → Maintain a heap of size k  
- Merge K Sorted Lists → Use heap to pick smallest node  
- Sliding Window Maximum → Use max-heap

---

## 7️⃣ Hash Maps / Dictionaries / Sets

**Key Patterns:**
- Counting → Frequency of elements  
- Two Sum / Pairing → Detect pairs or complements  
- Sliding Window with Count → Track characters in substring  
- Grouping / Categorizing → Group Anagrams, Count Elements

---

## 8️⃣ Trees

**Key Patterns:**
- DFS → Preorder, Inorder, Postorder traversal  
- BFS → Level-order traversal  
- Recursion / Divide & Conquer → Max depth, subtree sums  
- Binary Search Tree properties → Search, Insert, Delete efficiently

---

## 9️⃣ Graphs

**Key Patterns:**
- BFS → Shortest path in unweighted graph  
- DFS → Detect cycles, connected components  
- Topological Sort → DAG ordering  
- Union-Find / Disjoint Set → Connected components, cycle detection  
- Dijkstra / Bellman-Ford → Shortest paths with weights

---

## 10️⃣ Dynamic Programming

**Key Patterns:**
- 1D DP → Subarray, subsequence, Fibonacci, climbing stairs  
- 2D DP → Matrix problems, grid paths, edit distance  
- Memoization → Cache recursive calls  
- Bottom-Up / Tabulation → Iterative DP

---

## 11️⃣ Miscellaneous

- Bit Manipulation → XOR, bitmask, subset generation  
- Sliding Window → Strings & arrays for sums, counts, max/min  
- Greedy → Interval scheduling, activity selection  
- Backtracking → Permutations, combinations, Sudoku, N-Queens

---

💡 **Extra Tip:**  
- Focus on **patterns, not unique problems**.  
- Once you recognize the underlying pattern, solving new problems becomes faster and more systematic.
