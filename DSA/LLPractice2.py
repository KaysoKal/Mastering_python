"""
always have a head pointer to transver or modify the list 
use dummy nodes when need for merging, inserting an reording nodes for edge cases
travers using .next and be carefeul bc it can change the orginal strucure of the list so use temp
when reversing the list always use three pointers 
while condition use tq to process every node including last one 
use node.next when wanting to attach somehting to the last node in list


Think of a bookmark in a book ðŸ“–:

The book = the linked list.

The bookmark = your pointer (current).

The page you want to attached (current.next = page)

When you move the bookmark (current = current.next), the bookâ€™s content hasnâ€™t changed â€” only where youâ€™re looking.

So a pointer is just a way of keeping track of a position in the linked list without copying the whole thing.

âœ… Analogy with a train

current = current.next â†’ You walk forward to the next train car. ðŸš¶

current.next = current.next.next â†’ You unhook a train car and attach the engine directly to the car after it. ðŸš‚

ðŸ‘‰ So the key difference:

= on the left side is .next â†’ you are changing the list structure.

= on the left side is just a pointer variable â†’ you are moving your finger along the list.
