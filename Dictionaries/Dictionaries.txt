Intermediate Level: Filter and Modify a List of Dictionaries
Problem:
You are given a list of dictionaries representing students' information, where each dictionary contains the following keys:

"name" (string)
"age" (integer)
"score" (integer)
Write a function to filter out students who are younger than 18 and have a score below 50, and return the names of the remaining students as a list.

You need to use filter(), map(), and lambda functions to solve this.
