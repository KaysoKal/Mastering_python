## Focus Areas

- **Linux & Shell Scripting**: Command-line proficiency, system administration, and Bash automation.  
- **SQL & Databases**: Querying and managing relational databases for monitoring and infrastructure tasks.   
- **Python Syntax**: Basic Python syntax and small exercises to strengthen core concepts & Python OOP.  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**: Core programming skills to solve problems efficiently.    
- **Networking & Automation**: TCP/IP, DNS, routing, switching, firewalls, and troubleshooting with Python or Bash scripts for system and network tasks.  
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deploying and managing resources on AWS/Azure using VMs, storage, security, and IaC tools.  
- **Configuration Management & Orchestration**: Using Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes for automation and container management.  
- **Security**: Basic network security, system hardening, VPNs, and access controls.  
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Deployment pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS & Azure DevOps.
